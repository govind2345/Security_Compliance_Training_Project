<h1>Security Governance & Compliance Enablement Program</h1>

<p>
This project represents a corporate-style security training and governance
enablement solution designed for organizations operating in regulated
environments such as finance, government, and critical infrastructure.
</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>
Organizations often employ technically skilled security managers who lack
formal exposure to regulatory compliance, governance, and enterprise risk
management frameworks. This solution addresses that gap by translating
regulatory and risk principles into practical security decision-making tools.
